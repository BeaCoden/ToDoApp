# ToDoApp
## CBE Kata Project coding a ToDo App with JSON and State-Management

Hello everyone 🤓, 
as part of my participation in Coding-Bootcamps-Europe and as a newcomer in the realm of frontend web development, 
I have structured my code according to the motto: Make it work! 
As for Responsive Design, I can only say one thing: it's on my to-do list. 😅

I appreciate your feedback on my code and I welcome any suggestions for improvement. 🙏

You will soon find a link to my Miro board with direct access to my entity relationship model here as a link.
